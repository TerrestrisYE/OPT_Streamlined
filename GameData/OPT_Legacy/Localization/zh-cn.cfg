		#LOC_OPT_a_2m_bicoupler_desc = K 双头转接器能够提供两个而不是一个直径 3.75m 的连接点，被誉为航空航天业的一场革命。虽然总的来说它没有达到这些期望，但它确实成功地改变了将一件大事分成两件大事的新兴领域————这是它擅长的事情。 //Capable of providing not one, but two 3.75m attachment points, the K bicoupler was heralded as a revolution in the aerospace industry. While by and large it failed to live up to these expectations, it did manage to revolutionise the emerging field of splitting one big thing into two big things -- something at which it excels.
		#LOC_OPT_a_3m_tanks_desc = 它只是一个油箱，但它是一个容量非常大的油箱。 它的形状像一个盒子。 //It's just a fuel tank but it's a very high capacity fuel tank. And it's shaped like a box.

The hollow fuselage is really an oversized service bay. If something is too long to fit through the cargo door, it has some buffer room to fit in here.

		#LOC_OPT_opt_sage_desc = //With the positive reception from the creation of S.U.R.G.E., demand was quickly raised for a compact and economical version for smaller spaceplanes. The wildly popular J-61 engine frame was chosen but some design considerations have made it inadequate in thick atmosphere. As a result, this was named the S.A.G.E (Stratosphere Accentuated (Undulating) Gauss Engine).
		#LOC_OPT_opt_surge_desc = //The awkward design of this engine when it was first released was a factor to be considered when it bankrupted OPT. Assistance came from a mysterious agency called "Deep Sky," which presented a prototype engine refitted with what was called WarpJet, a technology for compressing and combusting any kind of air through a super-powered magnetic coil assembly. With scrutiny, OPT accepted and coupled the WarpJet with S.C.O.O.P., creating the S.U.R.G.E (Sidelong Undulating Respirating Gauss Engine).

It can cap the bottom of a 3.75m stack and it can even deploy its engine portion downward in order to fit very large wings (up to 0.5m thick).
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_lpj1_desc = //Keeping a small footprint is critical to many engineering goals. For this particular engine we have very much met the mark. As more of a bypass router than an actual engine, it gains power with velocity and is very fuel efficient but very demanding on the intake.

For a time, the majority responses to this phenomenon were "more boosters (with yaw gimbal)" or "just deal with it," however, after quite some time came the brilliant idea to produce an RCS device that was both aerodynamic and air-breathing.

But Wernher believed that Bob was a brave kerbal and he would never scream during flights. He thinks, the sound was caused by a special airframe shape interact with super high speed air. Upon further investigation, Werner published his theory on the 'Scream' effect. OPT's scientests applied this theory to their latest atmospheric propulsion project, although this resulted OPT in bankrupt, but they do now have the first ever ScreamJet! At low speeds, the engine operates as a regular turbojet. However, at higher speeds it screams! For a short period the 'scream' effect takes over which packs a powerful kick. At even higher speeds still, it explodes.
		#LOC_OPT_turboRamJetj_60d_desc = //It took quite a bit of prodding at OPT's execs before they could decide, in spite of their reputation for producing excellent air-breathing engines, to produce another dual-mode engine, specifically, a stackable one. This J-60D inherits the high thrust at high altitude potential which the J-61 is famous for, and LFO superpower near to that of the J-81 nacelle. Best of all, it's still a ScreamJet...so make sure that everyone has protective headphones.
