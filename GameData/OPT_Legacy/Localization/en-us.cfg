		#LOC_OPT_a_2m_bicoupler_desc = Capable of providing not one, but two 3.75m attachment points, the K bicoupler was heralded as a revolution in the aerospace industry. While by and large it failed to live up to these expectations, it did manage to revolutionise the emerging field of splitting one big thing into two big things -- something at which it excels.
		#LOC_OPT_a_3m_tanks_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_a_3m_fuselage_desc = It's half the hollow bay it used to be. Go figure.
		#LOC_OPT_a_6m_cargo_desc = A large cargo bay, presumably designed for containing suitably large cargo -- but with OPT's engineers, you never know.
		#LOC_OPT_a_6m_cargoTail_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_a_6m_tanks_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_a_6m_fuselage_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_a_cockpit_desc = The Chimera cockpit trades off a fair portion of the usual amenities, like seating area, the scented pine tree, and the bobbling hula girl on the dashboard, for increased survivability during reentry and easier ability to cut the atmosphere...which isn't a very good thing on descent, some will say. But hey, Rule of Cool applies.
		#LOC_OPT_a_cockpit_adaptor_desc = A modified adapter made to fit the unique Avatar shuttle cockpit. Also bundled with twin ram intake!
		#LOC_OPT_a_oms_hollow_desc = Highly anticipated and often demanded by clientelle with a classical persuasion, the inline SAS and RCS for the Avatar fuselage finally came to exist.
		#LOC_OPT_ab_3m_adaptor_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_ab_7m_adaptor_desc = Adapting to change can be hard. This handy fuselage section won't help, unless you happen to be changing from a Stail system part to its larger K type counterpart, in which case, it's just the thing.
		#LOC_OPT_a_8m_cockpit_desc = This large cockpit has seen high demand and was purpose built to meet the needs of the STS crowd in anticipation of advancement above and away from the popular Mk3 shuttle frame. Banking on the high potential of wide bodied cargo planes, OPT engineers even added hollow space within the cockpit for stashing important equipment and crew support resources that never need to be accessed in a cargo bay.
		
		// Communication
		#LOC_OPT_OPTantenna_title = OPT Ultra High Frequency Blade Antenna
		#LOC_OPT_OPTantenna_desc = Originally envisioned as a device to cut clouds into smaller pieces, the blade antenna allows atmospheric communication without compromising aerodynamics!  Originally owned and developed by Kerbal Space Industries but was recently obtained in an act of industrial sabotage and given a new paint job.

		#LOC_OPT_opt_powersphere2_title = OPT-E VS02-250 Power Core "Dark Energy"
		
		#LOC_OPT_opt_powersphere1a_desc = The VS00 series is an engine in every right, just not meant for propulsion. The trade secrets run deep behind how this majestic fuel cell operates, but if its codename is any indication, its workings may resemble the innards of a celestial body.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_powersphere1a2_desc = The VS00 series is an engine in every right, just not meant for propulsion. The trade secrets run deep behind how this majestic fuel cell operates, but if its codename is any indication, its workings may resemble the innards of a celestial body.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_powersphere1b_desc = Following the discovery and advanced reseach of 'Dark Goo', OPT's engineering division eventually reliably confirmed even more use for the Dark Goo. Involving some incredibly dense internal and electromagnetic construction material, we have enabled the Dark Goo to metabolize more powerful things than LiquidFuel and Oxidizer, and produce curious and exotic things!
		#LOC_OPT_opt_powersphere2_desc = Little did anyone know that building this kind of reactor bigger would cause its throughput to scale very much above linear. The gains and the amount of Dark Goo stored inside are so great that it's frightening! What if the Dark Goo somehow breaks out of this thing?!

		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_rudder1_tags = opt jet lift vertical heli rcs vern thrust tilt chop
		
		#LOC_OPT_arie73_desc = The "ARI", or Air-augmented Rocket Initiated Engine, is, or once was, a shining example of OPT's innovation. It retired on the advent of the OPT-E family of engine upgrades including the release of the ARI-75. This engine itself has been redefined and fills its own new niche. It is in every way as capable as the ARI-75 but no longer requires Oxidizer.
		#LOC_OPT_b_linear_aerospike_desc = An extremely powerful aerospike style rocket for an OPT fuselage. When advertising its capabilities, OPT stressed that it wasn't all about the small print, and that we should just focus on how cool it was. The small print, coincidentally, reads "CAUTION: liable to overheat."
		#LOC_OPT_J61_desc = This compact and vintage Mk2 engine has come to be widely known by both those who love OPT, and those who reject it. For an air-breather, the Starwaster is a force to be reckoned with, and an especially expensive ticket for those who want to go to space today. Maybe its nickname is to be taken seriously...
		#LOC_OPT_j81turbojet_desc = The kerbals at OPT's Propulsion Science Division can only be described as having met a supernatural entity, for better or worse, when they unveileved this piece of machinery. The performance characteristics on this thing make it seem to be 100 or 1000 years ahead of its time. Extreme caution and scrutiny are to be exercised by ...and toward...any pilot that asks repeatedly to fly a ship equipped with this engine.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_bubble1_desc = The Bubble is a uniquely advanced hybrid engine and an odd-ball among achievements. Within its compact frame are the abilities of a turbofan, ramjet and an overclocked ARI SCOOP rocket with performance like the J81. Oh, and it can tilt like a control surface.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_egg_desc = A special request was made by a space refinery corporation looking to haul heavy cargo in horizontal landers. While in the process of designing this engine for them a wise guy came up with this name and it stuck instantly. Unfortunately a few actual eggs were broken while half the engineering department laughed for minutes on end, reinforcing the name.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_egg_desc = A special request was made by a space refinery corporation looking to haul heavy cargo in horizontal landers. While in the process of designing this engine for them a wise guy came up with this name and it stuck instantly. Unfortunately a few actual eggs were broken while half the engineering department laughed for minutes on end, reinforcing the name.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_sage_desc = With the positive reception from the creation of S.U.R.G.E., demand was quickly raised for a compact and economical version for smaller spaceplanes. The wildly popular J-61 engine frame was chosen but some design considerations have made it inadequate in thick atmosphere. As a result, this was named the S.A.G.E (Stratosphere Accentuated (Undulating) Gauss Engine).
		#LOC_OPT_opt_surge_desc = The awkward design of this engine when it was first released was a factor to be considered when it bankrupted OPT. Assistance came from a mysterious agency called "Deep Sky," which presented a prototype engine refitted with what was called WarpJet, a technology for compressing and combusting any kind of air through a super-powered magnetic coil assembly. With scrutiny, OPT accepted and coupled the WarpJet with S.C.O.O.P., creating the S.U.R.G.E (Sidelong Undulating Respirating Gauss Engine).
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_heli1_desc = Not every OPT spaceplane breathes hypersonic air. Those that don't may find themselves in need of a high efficiency solution during operation at low velocities. Possesses nodes for 1.25m and 3.75m. Use of the 3.75m top node disables its intake. Its exhaust will not damage other parts so it can safely be chained in stacks.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_hc1_desc = It's not enough to have a lift engine that only woks in atmosphere so this sleek, aerodynamic behemoth is both a fan and a spike. It can cap the bottom of a 3.75m stack and it can even deploy its engine portion downward in order to fit very large wings (up to 0.5m thick).
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_lpj1_desc = Keeping a small footprint is critical to many engineering goals. For this particular engine we have very much met the mark. As more of a bypass router than an actual engine, it gains power with velocity and is very fuel efficient but very demanding on the intake.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_lpr1_desc = Keeping a small footprint is critical to many engineering goals. For this particular engine we have very much met the mark. The low profile Prominence engine is strong and advanced for its size and weight, however, it does not exploit airflow like the ARI series engines.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_lpr2_desc = Keeping a small footprint is critical to many engineering goals. For this particular engine we have very much met the mark. The low profile Irradiance engine is strong and advanced for its size and weight, however, it does not exploit airflow like the ARI series engines.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_rudder1_desc = OPT's executives have long been aware of a peculiar phenomenon that occured during the ascent phase that they have internally dubbed "phantom yaw." For a time, the majority responses to this phenomenon were "more boosters (with yaw gimbal)" or "just deal with it," however, after quite some time came the brilliant idea to produce an RCS device that was both aerodynamic and air-breathing.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_wrapl1_desc = This powerful accessory, the Fuselage Vertical Thruster hooks on at the sides of the fuselage and includes working intake and exhaust shutters to protect its innards from the fires of reentry. Be careful not to fire this engine while the exhaust shutter is closed!
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_wrapl2_desc = This powerful accessory, the Fuselage Vertical Thruster hooks on at the sides of the fuselage and includes working intake and exhaust shutters to protect its innards from the fires of reentry. Be careful not to fire this engine while the exhaust shutter is closed!
		#LOC_OPT_turboRamJetj_60_desc = Kerbal scientests used to thought that Bob kerman screams at the back seat when his craft flew pass mach 3. But Wernher believed that Bob was a brave kerbal and he would never scream during flights. He thinks, the sound was caused by a special airframe shape interact with super high speed air. Upon further investigation, Werner published his theory on the 'Scream' effect. OPT's scientests applied this theory to their latest atmospheric propulsion project, although this resulted OPT in bankrupt, but they do now have the first ever ScreamJet! At low speeds, the engine operates as a regular turbojet. However, at higher speeds it screams! For a short period the 'scream' effect takes over which packs a powerful kick. At even higher speeds still, it explodes.
		#LOC_OPT_turboRamJetj_60d_desc = It took quite a bit of prodding at OPT's execs before they could decide, in spite of their reputation for producing excellent air-breathing engines, to produce another dual-mode engine, specifically, a stackable one. This J-60D inherits the high thrust at high altitude potential which the J-61 is famous for, and LFO superpower near to that of the J-81 nacelle. Best of all, it's still a ScreamJet...so make sure that everyone has protective headphones.
			
		// Drop Tanks
		#LOC_OPTdropTank_title = OPT DropTank Mk I
		#LOC_OPTdropTank2_title = OPT DropTank Mk II
		
		#LOC_OPTdropTank_desc = Not only is this standardised aerodynamic drop tank able to contain a decent amount of liquid fuel or oxidizer, it also won't spontaneously combust! We hope so, anyway.
		#LOC_OPTdropTank2_desc = Larger, more reinforced drop tank, in fact 1.5 times larger.
		
		// Humpback
		#LOC_OPT_jl_3m_adaptor_title = OPT Humpback to J Short Adapter

		#LOC_OPT_l_3m_bicoupler_desc = The largest bicoupler ever seen. It allows for attaching 3.75m parts such as the Dark Drive.
		#LOC_OPT_l_6m_cargo_desc = A standard OPT cargo bay, it is almost able to hold 3.75m cargo and almost as much fuel as a jumbo orange tank.
		#LOC_OPT_l_6m_crew_desc = This OPT cabin is the largest and most spacious ever designed. Ignoring the fact that the Humpback body is antiquated, passengers and crew still eagerly ask to ride here and operate in its cockpit.
		#LOC_OPT_l_6m_fuselage_desc = A hollow Humpback fuselage. It's perfect for fitting in tanks of even more fuel, or wide landers.
		#LOC_OPT_l_7m_cargoTail_desc = The ramp for the Humpback body. Unfortunately it is buggy.
		#LOC_OPT_l_8m_cockpit_desc = A huge and somewhat monstrous cockpit. It is just one of two OPT cockpits with the highest number of seats.
		#LOC_OPT_l_oms_hollow_desc = Some engineers even with OPT had wanted for a long time for this very part to come to market. Unfortunately, right after they decided to start assembling a concept part for themselves, the aerodynamic thruster blocks began rolling off the assembly lines. These engineers decided to compromise and they submitted their project as basically a Utility part carrying basically a Utility part carrying only the tank and torque wheels. Their rebellion was fortnately not enough to get them sacked or worse.

		#LOC_OPT_b_4m_lab_desc = A science module for the Stail system spaceplane parts. Despite a suspicious odour of rocket fuel, OPT representatives were quick to assert that it was not, in fact, just a refurbished fuel tank and there was no need to worry about sparks. They did, however, caution against smoking in the science lab. 
		#LOC_OPT_b_4m_tail_desc = A for aerodynamic
		#LOC_OPT_b_cockpit_desc = Bigger, larger, and flatter than any previous J-series cockpit. While among engineers it has earned the nickname 'shovelnose,' OPT guarantee us that this is merely due to a passing aesthetic resemblance rather than its aerodynamic properties, nor any tendency to bury itself in the ground.
		#LOC_OPT_b_cockpit_qs_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_b_dropBay_mk2_desc = After a few individuals complained about the necessity of using boosters to remove rovers, OPT engineers designed this drop bay to allow you to drop your vehicles directly downwards. The Mk2 Variant has no bulkheads.
		#LOC_OPT_b_oms_desc = 
		#LOC_OPT_b2_4m_adaptor_variant_desc = An aerodynamic 2.5m to Stail system adapter that can be configured for a variety of different tank setups. Engineers agree that it's a step up from the previous solution of duct tape.
