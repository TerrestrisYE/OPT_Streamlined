		Version 3.0
		change = Added Localization support.
		change = Added missing attach nodes to Avatar Inline SAS.
		change = Added 2.5m "Tidal Force" power sphere. Produces 600 EC/s on LFO.
		change = * Re-titled all power spheres.
		change = Adjusted air-breathing performance of J-60D engine. It was really lacking the high altitude runaway thrust behavior. I officially have a love/hate relationship with this engine.
		change = * Adjusted J-60 stationary thrust to match.
		change = Changed J-81 engine behavior to be as advanced NTR/NTJ.
		change = Decreased RCS thrust in Rudder engine.
		change = Fixed broken heat limit key in Stail bicoupler. (Spotted by @ Lisias.)
		change = Fixed cost (was way underpriced) in Bubble engine.
		change = Fixed K Drone Core's SAS module still missing.
		change = Increased thrust in these engines:
		change = * J-81 engine.
		change = * Valkyrie tilt & WarpJet MARGE.
		change = * VTOL wrapper engines.
		change = Moved the following to OPT Main:
		change = * 2.5m Nebula Shock Intake.
		change = * VTOL Wrapper engines for J and K.
		change = * Avatar tilt and WarpJet MARGE engine.
		change = * DepthMask assets.
		change = * K cockpits (custom, TAV). All 3 K cockpits are now there.
		change = * K cabin and lab.
		change = * K and KH Inline SAS.
		change = The following VTOL engines remain:
		change = * Bubble.
		change = * EggDog.
		change = * HeliCarrier.
		change = * Low-Profile series.
		change = * Slipstream rudder engine.
		change = * Wrapper engines for Humpback.
		change = Nerfed excessive undeployed drag of airbrakes.
		change = Removed obsolete keys from some air-breathing engines.
		change = Removed extra lift module from K lab.
		change = Updated DepthMask patch to detect standalone DepthMask plugin.
		change = Updated offset between inner and outer stack nodes of Avatar and Humpback bays to make it less likely to attach them the wrong way and break cargo shielding.
