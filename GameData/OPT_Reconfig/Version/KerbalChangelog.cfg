{
	showChangelog = True
	modName = OPT Reconfig
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.3
		change = Adjusted Dark Drive options to detect "SystemHeatConverters" to cure System Heat conflict.
		change = Created Extras folder containing:
		change = * OPT_Reconfig_CryoEngines.cfg - Except for RO users, this has been moved out and is now completely optional.
		change = * OPT_Reconfig_LessHandwavium.cfg - Changes engine behaviors and Tidal Force power spheres to be more "stockalike" or "realistic."
 		change = * OPT_Reconfig_ZeroHandwavium.cfg - Includes the former and deletes the "Dark Energy" power spheres and end-game engines.
		change = * OPT_Reconfig_LessB9ForTweakScale.cfg - Disables B9 toggles for engines and converters as TweakScale doesn't handle them well.
		change = Fixed OPTSAS problem.
	}
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.2
		change = Added Feature Bias "B" tweakable. Edit the values in `OPT_Reconfig/OPT_00Tweak.cfg` to your liking. Not tested for use with RealismOverhaul but should still work just fine. This tweakable allows for:
		change = * [1] Reducing the handwavium nature of most OPT engines and the "Tidal Force" (fuel cell) power spheres: give them stockalike or more realistic:tm: behavior.
		change = * [2] Option [1] + Deleting the Dark Drive, WarpJets, Bubble engine, and "Dark Energy" (fusion) power spheres.
		change = Enabled all OPT body parts to hold IntakeAtm for maximum use of WarpJets.
		change = Fixed redundant FFT Antimatter containment module on parts.
		change = Fixed other fatal Classic Stock issues.
		change = Improved or fixed integration with Classic Stock and Rational Resources.
	}
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.1.2
		change = Fixed SystemHeat detection. It was expecting a catch-all patch which isn't as abundant in players installs as I assumed.
	}
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.1.1
		change = Added SystemHeat detection to B9-involved converter modules.
		change = Fixed new CryoEngines problem due to VIsp config.
	}
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.1
		change = Added kOS Processor to all drone cores.
		change = Added Far Future Tech derived system:
		change = * Dark Drive now uses OPT Black Hole resource instead of Dark Goo.
		change = * Dark Drive is now a true interstellar grade engine derived from Kugelblitz sci-fi engine. No longer useful in atmosphere.
		change = * Dark Drive is useless without OPT Reconfig as Reconfig contains Black Hole resource definition.
		change = * Enabled OPT bodies to hold FFT propellants including Antimatter and to carry the containment module.
		change = Fixed RO antenna patch to detect RealAntennas and not RO.
		change = Revised "Dark Energy" power sphere fuel options.
		change = Revised Dark Goo system:
		change = * "Dark Energy" power spheres hold this by default and not XenonGas.
		change = * Dark Goo is its own fusion fuel option and no longer a component of all other fusion fuel options.
		change = * Phased out Dark Science.
		change = Tiny fixes.
		change = Updated Tweakscale configs to be less likely to be overlapped by foreign Tweakscale modlets which then cause fatal exceptions.
		change = Updated file names and NEEDS concerning CRP vs Classic Stock to reduce likelihood of fatal issues concerning WBI play mode switcher.
		change = Updated detection concerning stock inventory system.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 3.0
		change = Added heat limit upgrades for H noses. (Bundled with Mk2 nose upgrades.)
		change = Added KSP 1.11 stock inventory to crewed parts.
		change = Added Localization support.
		change = Added Realism Overhaul support.
		change = Fixes to IntakeAtm and CryoEngines patches.
		change = Removed GPOSpeed fuel patch. Unknown if it supports WBI Omnistorage.
		change = Rewrote WBI integration and phased out Pathfinder legacy templates. It's all OmniConverters and OmniStorage. Always has been.
		change = OPT in ClassicStock play mode uses "PropLox" fuel mix (Propellium + Oxidizer, equivalent to Hydrolox).
